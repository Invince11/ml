At Vernacular.ai we work on a lot of interesting problems in speech tech. Many
of these have potential to come out in the form of articles which might be
interesting and valuable for other people working in the field. With this blog
we are trying to experiment in that direction by committing to a more active
involvement with the speech scene.

A post here will mostly be of one of the following, non-exhaustive, kinds:

+ Journeys of systems, processes and people in the team.
+ Introductions to a new/old problem, tutorials etc.
+ Deeper posts, insightful explanations, research findings etc.
+ Opinion pieces on the technologies we work with.
+ Notes on processes that we follow internally.
+ News, releases etc.

Many of these might be syndicated, with original posts on authors' personal
pages. We are also trying to set up a peer review protocol to help us decide
what qualifies to be published here along with a rough minimum frequency of
posts.

Stay tuned to our [rss feed](https://vernacular-ai.github.io/ml/rss.xml) for new
posts.
